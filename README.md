# COVID-19 Bike Sharing Data Analysis Project

### Overview

The purpose of this project is to scrape and chart bike sharing data throughout the United States during the Covid-19 pandemic. It's also a chance for me to experiment with CI/CD tools, deployment techniques and static site generators such as GitHub Actions, Hugo and Netlify. 

I will start off with Citibike(NYC) data first, then make this project open for collaboration for other cities once the first iteration of the project is done.
